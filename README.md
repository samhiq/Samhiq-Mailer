## 🔒 Setting Up App Password for SMTP Access

To use Samhiq-Mailer with Gmail's SMTP for email sending, you need to create an "App Password." Follow these steps to generate an App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**
   - Go to your [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).
   - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled.

2. **Access App Passwords:**
   - Under the "Security" section, find and click on "App passwords" or a similar option.

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - In the "Select app" dropdown, choose "Other (Custom name)."
   - Specify a custom name for the application (e.g., "Samhiq-Mailer") and click "Generate."

4. **Copy App Password:**
   - Google will generate a unique app password.
   - Copy this generated app password; you will use it to authenticate Samhiq-Mailer with Gmail.

5. **Use App Password in Samhiq-Mailer:**
   - When prompted for your Gmail password within Samhiq-Mailer, use the app password generated in the previous step.
   - This app password ensures secure access to your Gmail account via SMTP without revealing your main account password.

By following these steps, you enhance the security of your Gmail account while allowing Samhiq-Mailer to use SMTP for efficient email sending. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out for assistance. Happy emailing! 📧✨
